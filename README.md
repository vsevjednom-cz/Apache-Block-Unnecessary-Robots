# Block-Stupid-Robots-in-Apache-and-Fail2ban
Apache configuration for block weird robots and attacks of robots.

Block robots = better money from AdSense. AdSence thinks that robots are fake web-visitors. AdSense hates robots. 

Block IP addresses in Fail2ban works better and faster than only in iptables.

apache-lj.conf = Fail2Ban
apache2.conf = Apache
jail.conf = Fail2Ban
